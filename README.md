**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Systems Engineer/Musician/GymGoer)`**

Graduated from Universidad Nacional Experimenta de la Fuerza Armada, I'm an full-stack developer and systems engineer building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All my coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I'm an enthusiast of all related to software engineering too, so i continously try to learn something new in order to make a great, clean, and scalable code for those who need my services. 
I also like to do other things like:
ðŸ“–&nbsp;reading books
ðŸŽ¸&nbsp;playing my guitar
ðŸ’ª&nbsp;and working out!
